##Replicator 1&amp;2 slicing defaults for Slic3r.

###Right now only Rep1 Accelerated slicing profiles are in here for *DUAL* machines using *ONLY ONE EXTRUDER*.

If you could help out with testing/adding more profiles, please do.
It would be amazing to be able to slice reliably with Slic3r on *any* makerbot machine.
